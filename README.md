Hypervester Alpha v1.0 ~
This should give you a general overview of what the tool is all about and how to go about using it. This is a the 
result of a project of mine to come up with better solution for gathering informations URLs for research and I tweaked it to align with 
my hacking needs. I also decided I was going to do everything in 
bash to make things easy on myself, well cause thats how I am :p

Hypervester is simple tool created for extracting emails from website or given domain .

The tool Enabled in two mode fast & slow. In first mode you have to specify sitemap of website .
Second mode is automatic .But it is slow :p 

i Get some help from the Original Harvester tool ~~

Usage of script :-
chmod +x Hypervester.sh
./Hypervester.sh
